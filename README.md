# pokedex-js-app

In this project, I learnt how to work with JavaScript. I then learnt how to combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS.
I also learnt how to use jQuery and Bootstrap.

This application shows a list of buttons. Each button has the name of a Pokemon. Once a button is clicked, a modal will appear with the details of that Pokemon.
